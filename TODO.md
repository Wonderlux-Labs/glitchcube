  - [ ] Personality-driven RGB lighting behaviors
  - [ ] Environmental response visual expressions

- [ ] **Multi-Modal Hardware Expression**
  - [ ] Coordinate TTS speech with RGB lighting changes
  - [ ] Add curiosity-driven visual behaviors

  - [ ] Scheduled artistic moments (hourly curiosity bursts, daily mood shifts)
  - [ ] Time-based personality changes (morning optimism, evening contemplation)
  - [ ] Weather-responsive behaviors using weather service
  - [ ] Audience size detection and response adaptation

- [ ] **Autonomous Conversation Initiation**
  - [ ] Curiosity-driven conversation starters when motion detected
  - [ ] Attention-seeking behaviors when ignored for extended periods
  - [ ] Environmental commentary and artistic observations
  - [ ] Proactive relationship building with repeat visitors

## Code Architecture Improvements (Supporting Interactive Features)

  - [ ] Remove direct HomeAssistant client coupling
  - [ ] Extract logging concerns to service layer
  - [ ] Simplify conversation flow for maintainability
  - [ ] Add proper dependency injection for testing

### LOW: Performance & Responsiveness  
- [ ] **Async Processing for Conversations**
  - [ ] Non-blocking AI API calls for more responsive interactions
  - [ ] Background processing for memory consolidation during active conversations
  - [ ] Connection pooling for external API calls
  - [ ] Optimize conversation response times

## Success Metrics for Interactive Experience

The Glitch Cube will be a successful interactive art installation when:
1. ‚úÖ **Multi-turn conversations**: Visitors can engage in natural flowing dialogue
2. ‚úÖ **Proactive engagement**: Cube initiates interactions based on motion/environment  
3. ‚úÖ **Hardware expression**: RGB lighting and audio dynamically respond to conversation mood
4. ‚úÖ **Relationship building**: System demonstrates memory and evolving interactions with visitors
5. ‚úÖ **Autonomous behaviors**: Artistic moments beyond pure reactivity to human input

## Home Assistant Integration Status ‚úÖ

**Status**: ‚úÖ Connected to Home Assistant at http://glitchcube.local:8123 (192 entities available)

### Entity Configuration Assessment:
Based on the live entity scan (see `docs/home_assistant_entities.md`):

#### ‚úÖ Available and Ready:
- ‚úÖ **weather.openweathermap** & **weather.forecast_home** - Weather data available
- ‚úÖ **input_text.current_weather** - Weather summary storage (working)
- ‚úÖ **media_player.tablet** & **media_player.tablet_2** - Audio output available
- ‚úÖ **camera.tablet** - Camera for visual input
- ‚úÖ **Motion detection infrastructure** - `input_boolean.motion_detected`, `input_boolean.human_detected`

#### ‚ùå Missing Entities (Need Configuration):
- ‚ùå **sensor.battery_level** - Battery monitoring (needs hardware sensor)
- ‚ùå **sensor.temperature/outdoor_temperature/outdoor_humidity** - Environmental sensors (needs hardware)
- ‚ùå **binary_sensor.motion** - Direct motion sensor (using input_boolean instead)
- ‚ùå **Light entities** - No RGB lighting configured yet
- ‚ùå **media_player.glitch_cube_speaker** - Needs renaming or alias

#### üéØ Immediate Integration Opportunities:
- ‚úÖ **TTS Integration**: Use existing `media_player.tablet` for speech output
- ‚úÖ **Motion Detection**: Use `input_boolean.motion_detected` and automations  
- ‚úÖ **Weather System**: Already integrated and working
- ‚úÖ **Camera Integration**: Use `camera.tablet` for visitor recognition
- üîß **System Monitoring**: Rich sensor data available (CPU, memory, temperature)

### Ready for Interactive Development:
Since HA is connected and has usable entities, we can proceed with interactive features using available hardware while gradually adding missing sensors.

## Notes

**Priority Focus**: Infrastructure components (BeaconService, Configuration validation) are critical for deployment safety and 24/7 gallery operation.

**Art Installation Context**: Tests should consider the unique requirements of an autonomous art installation running 24/7 in gallery environments with potential power issues, network instability, and resource constraints.
